# activitystreams2

[ActivityStreams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) library for node.js and TypeScript

This was originally created for [distbin](https://github.com/gobengo/distbin) and has worked well. But there is likely room for improvement. Please file issues if you notice bugs or would like to request new features that other systems handling ActivityStreams 2.0 data might need.
